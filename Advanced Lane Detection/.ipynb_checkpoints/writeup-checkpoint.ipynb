    "#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  [Here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines/blob/master/writeup_template.md) is a template writeup for this project you can use as a guide and a starting point.  \n",

    "### Camera Calibration\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Briefly state how you computed the camera matrix and distortion coefficients. Provide an example of a distortion corrected calibration image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for this step is in the cell of 'Step 2. Camera Calibration' of IPython notebook 'AdvancedLaneDetection.ipynb'.\n",
    "\n",
    "I start by preparing \"object points\", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image.  Thus, `objp` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and `objpoints` will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image.  `imgpoints` will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The sample chessboard images provided have 6x9 numbers of corners. The following image shows the corner points on chessboard images. There are three images we can not detect corners because they are too distorted and zoomed in too much that we can only view less than 6x9 corners.\n",
    "![alt text][image1]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I then used the output `objpoints` and `imgpoints` to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function. I applied this distortion correction to the test image (calibration image 1) using the `cv2.undistort()` function and obtained this result: \n",

    "\n",
    "### Pipeline (single images)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Provide an example of a distortion-corrected image.\n",
    "\n",
    "In IPython notebook Section 2.3, I apply the distortion correction to one of the test images. The left image is test image number 4, and the right one is the corresponding undistorted one.\n",
    "![alt text][image3]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you performed a perspective transform and provide an example of a transformed image.\n",
    "\n",
    "In section 2.4, I created a function called 'warper()' to transform the image into top-down view.\n",
    "I used images with straight line to benchmark and calibration the source and destiny points (Manually pick up the points from raw image, and tweak it until the straigt line image shows the lanes are parallel to the red box from the top-down-view image). \n",

    "| 705, 450      | 960, 0        |\n",
    "\n",
    "I verified that my perspective transform was working as expected by drawing the `src` and `dst` points onto a test image and its warped counterpart to verify that the lines appear parallel in the warped image.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you used color transforms, gradients or other methods to create a thresholded binary image.  Provide an example of a binary image result.\n",
    "In the IPython Notebook Section 3.2, I created functions for Sobel Absolute, Sobel Magnitude and Sobel Direction threshold to see which Sobel function can provide better visual on test images.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the IPython Notebook Section 4, I implemented a window slider to filter the image pixels belongs to right/left lanes. After sliding the window, I created a second order polynomial fit using the indices of the pixels.\n",

    "In the IPython Notebook Section 5, I computed the curvature of the lane detected. For example, the following curve, the curvature of left lane is 1551.6m, right lane is 731.4m and the vehicle is 0.2m to the right from the center of the lane.\n",

    "### Pipeline (video)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (wobbly lines are ok but no catastrophic failures that would cause the car to drive off the road!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video_output_full.mp4)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?\n",
    "From 38 to 44 seconds, when the road changes from black aspalt to brighter concrete, the performance of the script droped. Because the lane detection gets poors. To compensate that, I create a Line class to store the previous calculated poly-fit coefficients by using a queue, i.e 'current_fit'. I set the maximum length of this queue to be 5, so the calculation will always look maximum 5 previous frames to decide if the new fit coefficient should be kept or thrown away, by using a threshold value for the difference of coefficents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I decide to set the thresholds by comparing the fit coefficient of multiple frames, in order to get the magnitude for y0, y1 and y2. For example, the following fit coefficients of two frames gives us the difference between y0, y1 and y2 at corrspondingly: \n",
    "\n",
    "Difference at left lane y0,y1,y2:  [  2.33765514e-04   2.63533239e-01   7.07220789e+01]\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference at right lane y0,y1,y2:  [  4.00178000e-05   4.40609398e-02   7.98937195e+00]\n",
    "\n",
    "I ran a couple of simulation with printouts of the difference, providing them with a safe margin, I decide to choose 0.001, 1 and 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the pipeline is good enough for the project video, it is far from robust to deal with real world situations. To improve the quality of challenge videos, I have to go back to adjust the color space thresholdFor example, how to deal with really curvy roads, unmarked lane or poorly marked lane, or other complicated situation such as vehicle cutting into the lane or street road scenarios.\n"
